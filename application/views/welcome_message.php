<h2>The world in 2030</h2>
<p> The emergence of new forms of media has generated changes in what fun is and how it is perceived. In the meantime, some areas of life, such as education, totally lack fun and innovation.</p>
<h2>What?</h2>
<p> We want to address both problems and create edutain-me, an online platform that combines fun and education and will make learning fun again.  </p>
<h2>How?</h2>
<p>edutain-me suggests academically valuable and entertaining resources from the web (videos, quizzes, simulations, games, pictures etc.) according to userâ€™s interests, age, location and educational level. </p>
<h2>What makes it special</h2>
<p>The material is suggested and reviewed by educators, academics or researchers in various fields so that it is of a high quality. Users rate the material they were suggested and thereby the quality and fit should constantly improve.</p> 
<h2>Aim</h2>
<p>We want to enable users to find entertaining, relevant, valuable and meaningful resources in the complexity of the web and therefore contribute to the future of fun in learning.  </p>
